The purpose of this Github repository is to develop a **partial annotated** genome of _Periplaneta americana_ also known by its common name, the American cockroach.
## Abstract
> _Periplaneta americana_ or the American cockroach is an insect within the phylum arthropoda that has proven itself to be ubiquitous around the world as a result of global commerce.
> Additionally, this insect notoriously harbors organisms that are pathogenic towards humans, including _E. coli_ O157:H7 and _Samonella spp._ In conjunction, the American cockroach has not only manifested as a household pest but has become pervasive in numerous commercial environments.
> As a notion to add "insult to injury", these deleterious insects are becoming increasingly resistant to insecticides. Despite these factors, there are many phenotypic aspects that we do not know about this organism, chiefly in regards to its immune system.
> In an response to this, this repository will attempt to partially annotate the American cockroach genome with a focus on immune genes, so as to translate a computational basis into functional "wet lab" experiments.
